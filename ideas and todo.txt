crystals:
	* pixels getting stuck to each other
	* a sort of N runs avg?
	* light up pixels from center

Nerves/networks:
	* connect/move/disconnect
	* activate to leave pixels

NN:
	* neural network guiding small particles
	* NN working as IFS (instead of a function)


IFS:
	* Add perspective to generation (somehow?)
	http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/distancefractals/distancefractals.htm
	* add lens with chromatic aberrations
	* volumetric fractals with raytracing
		* add emission to palette (e.g. >0.8)
		* other material props?
	* density map saving (or just split generating/showing)
	* fractals on surface (need uv-mapped surface) to raytrace

Cellular automatton and stuff:
	* want to grow plants like https://twitter.com/lorenschmidt/status/1069559544471273472
	* but with trees
	* ecology systems in general
	* (maybe)on gpu for very very fast simulation
